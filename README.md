# PathPlanning
Implementation of Path Planning Algorithms
In "Dijkstra" and "A*" the code is written for the implementation of both algorithms on 2D grid.
The "triangle_intersection" checks if the 2 objects are intersecting or not thus by providing the vertices of one triangle in P1 and another triangle as P2, we can always varify. Here, we manipulate 2D objects as triangles and then use this algorithm.
